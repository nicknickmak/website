            While my high school was rich in opportunity for the arts, there was
            an imbalance. All the emphasis for the arts meant a lack of focus
            and resources STEM education, a career path I was interested in. To
            supplement my early passion for Engineering, I decided to start the
            school's{" "}

            no one knew about the idea I had. But when the word spread, other
            students with similar interests came. The team started with just me
            attempting to fundraise the registration fee of $6,000. Luckily,
            with the aid of a grant I applied for and the school's
            administration, I was able to begin my endeavors. Building the{" "}

            team's first year robot was tough. If it weren't for the help of the
            dedicated members and experienced parents, the team would not have
            had a functioning robot at all. While the robot did not do so well
            in competition the first year, it was an worthy accomplishment for
            the team nonetheless. In the following years, the team caught on
            successfully and expanded to 40+ members, becoming the largest
            organization in the school. From the founding team, I learned many
            skills from CAD, machining, Java robotics programming, electrical
            engineering, and business development. Currently,{" "}

            After graduating from UC San Diego with a degree in Computer
            Science, I began my professional journey as a software engineer. My
            career has spanned roles in both consumer and enterprise
            applications, where I have contributed to the development of
            scalable web applications, cloud-based solutions, and innovative
            user experiences. I have experience working with React and Angular,
            backend DotNet, MS SQL Server, and Microsoft Azure Cloud. My passion
            for technology drives me to continuously learn and adapt, and I
            enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver impactful
            products. Throughout my career, I have focused on writing clean,
            maintainable code and mentoring junior developers to help them grow
            in their roles.
